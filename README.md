<h2># Hi, I'm Eudes 👋</h2>

**Web designer UX/UI**, working in the world of web design since 2011. I have taken part in the web design and online marketing of big companies such as Bioparc, after finishing my studies in **Commercial Management and Marketing in Barcelona.**

This year I decided to expand my profile towards the area of programming by doing a bootcamp in Full Stack, totally motivated to continue **specializing as a Front End**.

I am a **proactive person**, with great initiative under the objective of achieving the best results. I like to get **100% involved in every project** I carry out and I am used to work in a team providing creative solutions.
